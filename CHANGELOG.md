# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

**Unreleased** section is about things that are been worked on or are just plans. They may or may 
not become part of a release, but they probably will.

**Initial Alpha Releases** section is about pre-releases. All releases in listed here are not really 
official releases, but they will have a package that can be downloaded to be used at your own risk. 
They are not expected to be stable. After the first official release, this section will be deprecated.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
